# Wind Turbine Control for Arduino
"Controllable Wind Turbine" with the project name of the system that monitors and controls the voltage, current and power of a non-industrial, individual (household) wind turbine and can rotate on a horizontal axis according to the wind direction.

## System Introduction
- Potential Wind Energy will first be transferred to the shaft by the propellers and mechanical energy will be obtained. Later, this mechanical energy will be converted into electrical energy by stepper motor electromagnetic induction.
- The turbine will rotate according to the wind direction.
- When the turbine rotates at high speeds, it will be braked.
- Converted electrical energy via using the voltage divider circuit ; The instantaneous voltage, instantaneous current, instantaneous power and turbine efficiency values will be read with the LCD screen.
- The instantaneous wind speed was obtained using the formula “P = 0.5 x p x Cp x V^3 x A”.
- With the menu displayed on the LCD screen, the value to be read will be determined by the IR Control.
- The energy to be obtained from the wind turbine will be stored in batteries.
- The system will feed itself.
- The system will be easy to transport and install.
